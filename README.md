# Noisy-and-Low-Light-Image-Enhancement-with-CNN

The goal of the project is to develop a computer vision system that can enhance low light and noisy images. Specifically, given an input image containing a region of interest (ROI) that is dark and/or noisy, the system should be able to produce an enhanced image of that ROI that is visually pleasing and improves the overall image quality. The system will utilize various image processing and deep learning techniques to achieve this goal. Additionally, the system will be able to handle input images of varying sizes and resolutions. Overall, the system aims to improve the usability and visual quality of low light and noisy images in a variety of real-world applications.
